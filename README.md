## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using data from the openpowerlifting database to answer following questions:

1. Where is powerlifting (outside USA) most popular?
2. How much do the three lifts (squat, benchpress, deadlift) interfere each other?
3. Can you predict the best deadlift attempt with the other two lifts and some additional data?

The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.  This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the process for individual steps.  
There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@kevinossner/how-much-can-you-deadlift-96f84ca5f3ee?source=friends_link&sk=0c663e94f4865971f505aff0189ce56e).
